    "Dr. Edward Davis specializes in natural nanomaterials, nanocomposites processing, and mechanical testing. He earned his undergraduate in biomedical engineering and master's in chemical engineering at Tulane, with a Ph.D. from the University of Akron on polymerizable microemulsions. He worked at Shell Chemicals, Belgium, researching polymer nanocomposite systems and later at EVAL, developing high barrier plastics. Joining Auburn in 2007, he transitioned to his current role in 2015. Davis has led diverse research projects and contributed significantly to Auburn's engineering education.",
